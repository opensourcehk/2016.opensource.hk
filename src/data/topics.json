      "<p>MQTT is a one of the popular messaging protocols for use on top of the TCP/IP protocol. It is convenient for near real time communication between Internet of Things. MQTT was invented in 1999 and initially it was used internally only by IBM. In 2010 version 3.1 was released royalty free and nowadays there are a lot of open source software MQTT brokers and clients.</p>",
      "<p>The most popular open source MQTT brokers are Mosquitto, HiveMQ, ActiveMQ and Mosca. Mosquitto is an Eclipse incubating project and it is written in the C programming language. HiveMQ is written in Java and it know as a enterprise MQTT broker. Mosca is popular among web developers as it is written in JavaScript.</p>",
      "<p>MQTT implements the publish-subscribe messaging pattern using a broker. All clients connect to the broker and subscribe to different topics. Each client is capable of publishing messages. The broker is responsible for delivering messages to subscribed clients. The work flow of a MQTT client is first to establish a connection with MQTT broker and after that to subscribe to a topic. At this point the client will receive messages from the broker depending on their topics. Furthermore, the client is capable of publishing messages at any time. Each MQTT message contains a topic which is used by the broker to forward it to the interested clients. Typically, the message also has a payload that could be a binary data, plain text, JSON, XML or anything else defined by the developer.</p>",
      "<p>The Last Will and Testament (LWT) is an advanced MQTT feature to notify other clients about an ungracefully disconnected client. Upon connecting to the broker each client can specify MQTT message which will be its last will. The broker will store the message until it detects that the client has disconnected ungracefully. This way the developer can understand when Internet of Things have disappeared unexpectedly. Furthermore popular MQTT brokers also support web sockets so web developers can expose data instantly to HTML5 web pages.</p>",
      "<p>Security if very important topic for Internet of Things. MQTT supports transport layer security (TLS/SSL) and authentication with username and password. Authorization policies can be implemented using access control lists. There is module for Mosquitto which allows integration with NoSQL and SQL databases.</p>"

More and more services are provided by hospitals and health-care organizations and allow doctors to provide diagnosis in patients' places in a regular basis. But the frequency is not high enough to provide timely diagnosis based on latest update of health condition. It brings us the idea to implement a cloud based system that can monitor health condition of users and allows doctors to provide timely diagnosis remotely.",

One of my contribution is yajs.vim(Yet Another JavaScript Syntax). One of the most powerful JavaScript syntax highlight plug-in for Vim now. It supports almost every new syntax from ECMAScript 2015, JSDoc, lots of new Web API and fixed several old issues. This talk will first explain Vim syntax system. The design, concept and limitation of it. Then will share the problems encountered during the development in this environment. And finally, how I solved these problems.",

The whole process may sound complicated and the concepts may be confusing to new comers. I will try to demystify the whole Linux packaging thing and detail how one should approach to delivering software to Linux systems. The knowledge would be useful for publishing any kind of software, including desktop application, command line utility, or software library.</p>"
